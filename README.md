## Description

The Logo Generator is a command-line application designed for freelance web developers who want to create simple logos for their projects without the need to hire a graphic designer. The application allows users to input text, choose text color, select a shape (circle, triangle, or square), and define the shape's color. It then generates an SVG file named `logo.svg` based on the provided criteria.
